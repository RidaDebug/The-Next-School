            Coding refers to the process of writing instructions for machines in such a way that they are able to
            understand <br>them and behave or respond accordingly. Coders, or programmers, are people who write the
            programs <br>
            behind everything we see and do on a computer. When children learn to code, it helps them to develop
            essential<br> skills such as problem solving, logic and critical thinking. Through coding, children can
            learn
            that there’s <br>often more than one way to solve a problem, and that simpler and more efficient solutions
            are
            often better. <br>Learning to code encourages children to become creators, not just consumers, of the
            technology
            they use.

        Children may be referred for a psychological assessment for a variety of reasons. Among other things, they may
        be depressed or anxious, have attention or behavior problems at home or in school, be subjected to bullying, or
        have a learning disorder. Often when kids are struggling in school or seem to be behind their peers
        developmentally, a counselor or teacher will suggest the child undergo a psychological assessment.

        The results of this type of evaluation will reveal which areas the child is doing well in and which are the ones
        he or she might need to address (for example: an undiagnosed learning disability).

        The Next School will provide a standardized psychological assessment for screening students at high risk of
        learning difficulties, ADHD, ADD etc. This will be followed by intervention by our team of qualified
        psychologists who will then focus on shortlisted individuals to provide recommendations for plans of action for
        the future. <br>
